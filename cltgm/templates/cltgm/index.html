        <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
        <p>
          Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop roleplaying game. While
          playing, you will gather around a table with your friends and go on
          an adventure as a character you create!

        <h2>For Parents</h2>

          D&D can help your kids learn problem-solving skills that require
          cooperation. Face-to-face interaction and social skills are key
          components of D&D, providing a fun learning environment for kids.
